    "report": "The MOL Cup match between Artis Brno and Sparta Praha on December 3, 2025, ended in a 2-1 victory for Sparta Praha. The match was held at ShipEx Aréna in Brno with an attendance of 5,716 spectators. Sparta Praha dominated possession with 75% compared to Artis Brno's 25%, and they also outshot their opponents 14 to 2.\n\nThe scoring opened in the 27th minute when Mercado J. of Sparta Praha scored with an assist from Kuol G. Artis Brno responded before halftime with a goal from Adediran Q. in the 41st minute, leveling the score at 1-1. The match remained tightly contested with both teams making several substitutions at the start of the second half.\n\nThe decisive moment came late in the game at the 89th minute when Rrahmani A. converted a penalty for Sparta Praha, securing the 2-1 lead. This penalty was awarded under controversial circumstances, as noted in post-match reports. Both teams received one yellow card each, and no red cards were issued.\n\nSparta Praha's ability to control the game and capitalize on their chances ultimately earned them the win and progression in the MOL Cup. The match was a display of tactical discipline and resilience, especially from Sparta Praha, who managed to survive the cup drama in Brno and advance to the next round."
