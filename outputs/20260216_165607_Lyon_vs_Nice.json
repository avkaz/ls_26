    "report": "In a Ligue 1 clash on February 15, 2026, Lyon secured a 2-0 victory over Nice at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais. Lyon demonstrated control throughout the match, holding 57% possession compared to Nice's 43%. The first half saw Lyon take the lead just before halftime, with Tolisso scoring in the 45+1 minute, assisted by Šulc. Despite Nice's efforts, Lyon doubled their advantage in the 64th minute through Nartey, sealing the win.\n\nBoth teams created opportunities, with Lyon registering 9 shots and Nice 10, but Lyon was more clinical with 2 shots on target to Nice's 3. Lyon also earned 8 corners compared to Nice's 5. The match was competitive and physical, reflected in the disciplinary actions: Lyon received 3 yellow cards, including for handball by Sanson and fouls by Maitland-Niles and Tessmann, while Nice had 1 yellow card for holding by Abner Vinicius.\n\nLyon's defensive resilience and effective attacking transitions were key to their success. The home side's passing accuracy was slightly higher at 89%, helping maintain pressure and control. Nice struggled to break down Lyon's defense despite having a few big chances. The match ended without any red cards or penalties, and no extra time was required.\n\nOverall, Lyon's tactical discipline and timely goals ensured a well-deserved home victory, maintaining their strong form in the league."
