    "report": "Sparta Praha delivered a commanding performance on home soil, defeating Zbrojovka Brno 4-0 in a one-sided encounter on October 30, 2024. The match, played at the epet ARÉNA in Prague, saw Sparta assert their dominance from start to finish, with a clinical display of attacking football and solid defensive organization.\n\nThe breakthrough came late in the first half, as E. Krasniqi found the net in the 40th minute, finishing off a well-worked move assisted by Q. Laci. This goal gave Sparta a deserved lead going into the break, reflecting their control of the game’s tempo and territory.\n\nThe second half saw Sparta Praha ramp up the pressure, and their efforts were rewarded in the 65th minute when J. Pešek doubled the advantage, with Krasniqi turning provider. Just six minutes later, K. Daněk added a third, effectively putting the result beyond doubt. The home side’s relentless attacking play culminated in an 80th-minute penalty, confidently converted by A. Rrahmani, sealing the emphatic 4-0 victory.\n\nZbrojovka Brno struggled to create meaningful chances throughout the match and were unable to break down Sparta’s disciplined backline. The visitors’ lack of attacking threat allowed Sparta to control possession and dictate the pace, rarely looking troubled at the back.\n\nWhile detailed statistics such as possession and shots were not available, the scoreline and goal timeline clearly illustrate Sparta Praha’s superiority on the day. The result will boost Sparta’s confidence as they continue their campaign, while Zbrojovka Brno will need to regroup after a difficult outing in Prague. Overall, it was a comprehensive win for Sparta, who showcased their quality in all areas of the pitch."
